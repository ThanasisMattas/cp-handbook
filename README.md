# CP-Handbook

The ultimate C++ collection of the algorithms in
**Competitive Programmer's Handbook** by Antti Laaksonen ([repo]).

This repository comprises some driver test cases along with the implementation
of each algorithm. The code is mostly an adaptation of the snippets seen in the
book. There are also examples for algorithms for which code is not provided.

## Usage

Read the analysis of the algorithm in the book. Try it yourself. If you get
stack, have a look here.
