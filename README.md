# CP-Handbook

The ultimate C++ collection of the algorithms in
[Competitive Programmer's Handbook] by Antti Laaksonen.

This repository comprises turnkey implementations of each algorithm. The code
is mostly an adaptation of the snippets seen in the book, with occasional extra
additions. There are also examples for methods for which code is not provided.

## Usage

Read the analysis of the algorithm in the book. Try it yourself. If you get
stack, have a look here.
